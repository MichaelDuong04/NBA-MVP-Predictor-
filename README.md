# NBA-MVP-Predictor

This is another fun project that I created to leverage my machine learning and data science skills, and combine that with my love for basketball!
This project is broken up into three parts:
  - Part 1 requires you to download the NBA data needed for webscraping. To download the data and files, I used the requests and Selenium libraries. To parse them, I used beautifulsoup and loaded them into pandas DataFrames.
  - Part 2 is actually cleaning the data and combining different stats using pandas so that we have a nice and simple DataFrame.
  - Part 3 uses machine learning to predict the MVP winners for each year. I prepared the data for machine learning using Ridge Regression and defined an error metric that allowed me to backtest across the dataset. I then refined my predictors and utilized a Random             Forest model to make the predictions.

To run this code, make sure you have access to Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab and import the files into them!
